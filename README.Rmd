# eds

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of eds is to acts as a minimal example of an R package. It contains functions to calculate the rolling mean of an vector and to install the package to a custom location.

## Installation

You can install the development version of eds from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zakvarty/eds")
```

## Examples

This is a basic example which shows you how to calculate the rolling mean of the first 6 powers of two.

```{r example}
library(eds)
powers_of_two <- 2^(0:5)
print(powers_of_two)
rolling_mean(x = powers_of_two, window_width = 3)
```

The helper function `pad_with_NAs()` might also be useful to you. Currently this only works on vectors but a similar method for matrices and arrays would be a nice addition. 

```{r}
pad_with_NAs(x = c("cat", "dog"), n_left = 1, n_right = 2)
```
<!-- 
What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
